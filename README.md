# Cascade Mask-RCNN + Swin-Transformer in Tensorflow 2

A Cascade Mask-RCNN with Swin-Transformer as backbone implementation in Tensorflow 2. Based on Nvidia's implementation of Mask-RCNN (https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow2/Segmentation/MaskRCNN) and rishigami's implementation of Swin-Transformer (https://github.com/rishigami/Swin-Transformer-TF)
Supports four-channel input (RGBD)
